# DynED
The datasets that DynED is evaluated on are available in the Dataset folder.
To run the DynED, please install the Scikit-multiflow package. Be noted that the last version of scikit-multiflow is compatible with Python 3.8 and requires specific version of Numpy and Pandas Packages. all the installation instructions are provided on the home website of scikit-multiflow https://scikit-multiflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html 
Then, open the DynED.py file with any IDE or Jupyter Notebook and simply replace the full path of the dataset you are trying to evalute with "Put the full address and name of the dataset here".
Next run the Python Script. It will output the Mean accuracy of DynED on the dataset provided to it.
